In May 2020 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52771095) on the most increased searches for "delivery" queries in the UK, based on analysis of data from Google Trends.

We looked at the biggest risers in search interest for words/phrases including “delivery” in the UK and found that towards the end of May there was a surge in people wanting “cream tea” deliveries to their homes.

The data in this repo shows that relative search interest over the past year and over the past five years as well as comparisons with other big risers on Google Trends.
